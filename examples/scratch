   what is an ion: is it an Atoms with a charge? or is an Atom an ion with a charge? 
   or... are they unrelated classes. ?

   so we always start from the prespective! 

   from a non reactive simulation perspective, we need separate classes! but if we are describing a reaction, where Atoms may become ions on a whim, then this may not be the case. 



 CUDS.PARTICLE: 

 if a particle has proton and electron then its an atom, etc..
